        "Before clicking “Yes”, the page remains unchanged (question + subtitle + two buttons, with evasive “No”).",
        "After clicking/tapping “Yes”, both buttons are hidden and the heading “Good choice ❤️” remains visible exactly as-is.",
        "Under “Good choice ❤️”, the 5 provided lines appear in order, each on its own line.",
        "The 5-line message uses a simple fade-in animation (no typing animation), and the animation does not cause layout shift or accidental scrolling on mobile/tablet (including iPad Chrome).",
        "No meme image or photo is introduced as part of this change."

  "constraints": [
    "Frontend immutable paths (hooks and main entry files listed in SYSTEM_CONTEXT) must not be edited.",

  "nonGoals": [
    "Adding backend persistence or storing user responses.",
    "Adding login/authentication changes.",
    "Adding new buttons, routes, or multi-page flows.",
    "Implementing complex animations such as typewriter, confetti, or additional interactive sequences beyond a simple fade-in for the new text."
