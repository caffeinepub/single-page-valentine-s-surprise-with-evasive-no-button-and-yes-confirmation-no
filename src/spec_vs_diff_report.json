  "summary": "REQ-6 is partially implemented: the App now conditionally shows a confirmation state with “Good choice ❤️” and attempts to render a 5-line message with a fade-in class, but the provided diff is truncated and shows at least one line text mismatch and an incomplete 5th line. The diff also introduces additional decorative/animation elements beyond the requested simple fade-in text.",

      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Render the 5 provided lines exactly (including punctuation/characters) beneath “Good choice ❤️” after clicking/tapping Yes.",
      "reason": "The 4th line uses a straight apostrophe (\"I'll\") instead of the required curly apostrophe (\"I’ll\"), and the 5th line is truncated/does not show the required full text.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (shows `I'll try not to be too annoying… maybe 😅` and a truncated 5th line starting with `Ca...`)"

      "requirement": "The 5th line must be exactly: \"Can’t wait to see where this goes!\"",
      "reason": "The 5th line content is not present in full in the diff; it is truncated to `Ca...`, so it cannot be verified as correctly implemented.",

      "reason": "REQ-6 only asks to add a simple fade-in 5-line message after clicking Yes and explicitly discourages additional complex/extra sequences beyond the simple fade-in; floating animated hearts are additional animated decoration not requested.",
